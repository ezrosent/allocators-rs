// TODO:
// - When different cores are accessing this, do we have false cache line sharing issues?
// - Currently, when we're resizing, every time we move a pointer from the current bucket to its
//   new bucket, we just call insert() on the new bucket. This re-traverses the bucket from the
//   beginning. We can do better - we could keep track of what bucket/index we're currently at, and
//   start the next search from that point.
// - Once Vec and Box support parametric allocators, use that functionality.
// - Is there something safer we can do for the value field of empty buckets other than
//   mem::uninitialized?

// Design
//
// This hash table is designed to perform well under the conditions present when used with the
// large slab allocator. In particular, it is designed for workloads where:
// - Insertions and deletions are infrequent, but lookups are very common (lookups are caused by
//   allocs or deallocs, while insertions and deletions are caused by allocing or freeing entire
//   slabs)
// - An already-inserted value will never be inserted again, and a non-existent value will never be
//   deleted
// - Keys are pointers which all share a common alignment
// - Since, for the most common page size (4096 bytes), the smallest object for which large slabs
//   are used is ~512 bytes, the space used by the hash table is assumed to be dwarfed by the space
//   used to back allocated objects. Thus, space is taken to be cheap.
// - The slab allocator's working set algorithm should prevent thrashing. That is, even if a large
//   number of objects are freed very quickly and then allocated very quickly, the working set
//   algorithm will refuse to free these slabs. The only way for thrashing to be a problem is for
//   the sequence of frees and the sequence of allocs to be separated by a full working period
//   (15 seconds as of the writing of this comment).
//
// Given this workload profile, we make the following design decisions:
// - We assume that, since insertions and deletions are infrequent, the cost of allocating and
//   freeing buckets is negligible. However, the cost of traversing pointers in a bucket chain is
//   NOT negligible. Thus:
//   - We make sure to always keep buckets coalesced (with all full slots bunched at the beginning
//     before any empty slots) at the cost of a slightly more expensive delete operation.
// - The hash table does not support inserting existing keys or deleting non-existent keys. This
//   makes the implementation somewhat simpler.
// - Since keys are pointers with a common alignment, the hash function is trivial: shift the key
//   by the alignment. This produces some patterns in what buckets are used, but in practice most
//   buckets end up with 2-3 elements and occasionally 4 elements (note that this is dependent on
//   our choice of when to resize, which is discussed below). Note, however, that the shift is
//   very important! Without it, keys would all cluster in the lower 1/nth of the table (where n
//   is the alignment).
// - Since space is cheap, we choose buckets to have 4 slots and for the hash table to grow (by
//   doubling the number of buckets) as soon as the number of elements stored is equal to the
//   number of buckets. In practice, we've observed that this results in buckets almost never
//   overflowing. This choice also means that the hash table takes up at most approximately
//   512/(4 * 8) = 1/16 of the space required by the allocated objects themselves.
// - Since high-frequency thrashing is prevented by the slab allocator's working set algorithm, it
//   is safe to not only use the growing scheme described in the previous bullet, but also to use
//   a similar shrinking algorithm - to halve the number of buckets when the number of elements
//   stored is equal to half the number of buckets.
