//! This module includes some lightweight utilities for tracing different allocation events.
//! Like all global abstractions in use here, some hacks are required to get this to work correctly
//! when this library is linked as part of a `malloc`.
//!
//! ## `THREAD_CTR`
//!
//! We use a global `AtomicUsize` to creat thread Ids rather than `thread::current().id()`. This is
//! because the latter method panics somewhere when setting thread metadata during thread creation.
//! This is presumably some ill-fated `malloc` dependency.
//!
//! ## `RefCell`
//!
//! While `RefCell` is probably the correct thing to use here regardless, we really must use some
//! version of it. This is because the stat collection infrastructure can recursively call itself
//! during thread initialization time because TLS can call `calloc`. This is similar to a problem
//! encountered in the `general::global` in this crate. `RefCell`'s `try_borrow` gives us a guard
//! against this recursion.
